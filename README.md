# JoystickView

## Installation :

- Download JoystickView.zip in the realease v1.0
- Go in the bakkesmod folder and drag/drop the data + plugins folders
- ingame, in the bakkesmod window go in the plugins tab -> pluginmanager, click on open plugin manager and check JoystickView to load it

Now it should appear on the left in the plugin list, click on it. There you can open the overlay by clicking on open plugin window, and you can change the location + the size of the arrow with the sliders.
You can bind the overlay on a key if you want, here is the command to assign : togglemenu JoystickView
You can also change the images of the overlay, just go on the bakkesmod folder/data/JoystickView/, here replace the images if you want (note that if you replace an image, it must be the same file name as before, otherwise the plugin won't recognize it), and don't forget to reload the plugin to get the image updated
